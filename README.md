# MusicLog
Final Project for Mobile App Development Course 

My final project is an Android app with the goal to assist musicians. My final project was a Music Practice Assistant. 
It's an app that has three main features to help a user practice their instrument. First is the music log, which uses the Firebase Realtime
Database. The users can log their practice session and enter information such as the date, song they're working on, 
the instrument they're practicing and duration of practice. 
Next feature are the practice tools.On this page there users can use an audio recorder to record their sessions. 
This uses the Android MediaRecorder API. Their is also a timer feature where they can set the time. 
This was implemented with the CountDownTimer Class. 
Last feature are music resources where there's convenient buttons that link to websites such music theory, music scales and glossary.
